### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an eager full stack software development student about to graduate and excited to continue to expand my abilities in the workplace.  This entire repository is from projects that I have done over the last 4 months with techniques and tools I have learned during that time.  I have kept even my most rudimentary projects as a reminder of how far I have come.  I hope you enjoy perusing my work.  Cheers!
